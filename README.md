## Handy Commit Message Hook When Working on Ticketed or Structured Feature Branches
- If your workflow involves creating and commiting to branches with a determined structure such as issue-1234-great-new-feature, this commit message hook will prepend `[ISSUE-1234]` to all your commit messages, making your commit messages more organized and readable!

## Instructions
- Copy the install-hooks folder into your git repo and run install.sh.
- Alternatively, just copy the `prepare-commit-msg` file into the `.git/hooks/` directory in your git repo!
